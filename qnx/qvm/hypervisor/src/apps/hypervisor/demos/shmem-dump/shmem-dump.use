%C	- shared memory example program from a host system

Running this in the host system will create a connection to a hypervisor
shared memory object called "testing". Anything you type at this program's
standard input will be sent to all other clients connected to "testing" and
everything typed at their stdin's will reported on this program's standard
output.

Type "quit" to cause the program to cleanly terminate.
