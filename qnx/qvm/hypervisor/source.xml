    <description>This package is intended to be wrapped around a standard BSP (which is to be included in images/components/ by the build), such that: all of the standard BSP's IFS build files are enabled with Hypervisor; some hypervisor-specifics are added to the BSP's IFS build files; a disk image is produced with the host's IFSs included in a bootable dos partition, as well as a larger data partition; and a few guests are included in the disk image's data partition (also to be placed in images/components by the build)</description>
