Compiling monartis-enhanced openQNX
-----------------------------------

In order to compile QNX, you have to install Momentics (6.4.0 is ok) locally, because some of files required by the OS
are not in the basic kernel (recall that openQNX follows a microkernel architecture, and some parts like
file systems, drivers, etc. do not belong to the kernel).

Then, the files qnx_env and qconf_override_mk must be adapted accordingly.


1) change dir to trunk

2) compilation for x86 and nto (neutrino)

make CPULIST=x86 OSLIST=nto hinstall
make CPULIST=x86 OSLIST=nto install

3) using QNX with QEMU

- Use the build_cmd(_with_create for the first time) script to create an image
- Type qemu -hda qnxfs.img
