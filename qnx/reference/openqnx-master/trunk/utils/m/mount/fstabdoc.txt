The format of the /etc/fstab used with the mount utility 
is as follows:

  specialdevice mountpoint type mountoptions 

for example:

  /dev/hd0t77 /mnt/fs qnx4 rw

which would be equivalent to calling:

  % mount -t qnx4 /dev/hd0t77 /mnt/fs 

The mountoptions are a comma separated list of values
that must contain, at a minimum, one of "ro" or "rw"
to indicate a read-only or a read-write mount.

By default the mount is performed with the type as
if the -t option had been specified (device and server
doing the mount are the same) but to get the -T type
behaviour you can specify "allservers" in the options.

The following sample /etc/fstab indicates the mapping
of the different configurations:

#This is a sample file that shows the mapping of command line
#arguments to the fstab entries and how they would be invoked
#The "implied" argument is not generally required, but some
#servers may differentiate between implied and specified entries

# ./mount -b -vvv -t mytype /my/specialdev1 /my/mountpoint1
# ./mount -vvv /my/mountpoint1
/my/specialdev1 /my/mountpoint1 mytype rw

# ./mount -b -vvv -t mytype /my/specialdev2
# ./mount -vvv /my/specialdev2
/my/specialdev2 / mytype rw,implied

#./mount -b -vvv -T mytype /my/specialdev3 /my/mountpoint3
# ./mount -vvv /my/mountpoint3
/my/specialdev3 /my/mountpoint3 mytype allservers,rw

#./mount -b -vvv -T mytype /my/specialdev4
# ./mount -vvv /my/specialdev4
/my/specialdev4 / mytype allservers,implied,rw
