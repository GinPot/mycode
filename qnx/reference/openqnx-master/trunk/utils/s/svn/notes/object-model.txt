		     The Subversion Object Model
                     ---------------------------

Rules of thumb for translating Subverion's C header files
(subversion/include/svn_*.h) into a wrapper language's object model:

* C modules define a Java package, Python module, etc.

* Module functions and callbacks should be methods of an
  interface/mix-in.

* Batons are opaque data structures, and can be represented as empty
  interfaces or callable objects.  Contexts are generally represented
  as class state.

* In languages for which it is applicable, returned svn_error_t's
  should be declared as thrown exceptions.
