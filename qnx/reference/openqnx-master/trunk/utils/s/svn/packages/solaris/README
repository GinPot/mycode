The script in this directory will attempt to build a Solaris package
out of a source tree for subversion.

To build a package, make sure you are in the root of the source tree,
and run:

build/pkg/buildpkg.sh

A Solaris package called subversion-<version>-<architecture>-local.gz will be
created in the root of the source tree.

By default, the script will attempt to find a system installed version of
APR and APR-util v1. You may override the location of apr or apr-util like so:

build/pkg/buildpkg.sh --with-apr=some/other/path --with-apr-util=some/other/path

The --with-neon and --with-apxs flags will allow you to specify the location of
the neon and httpd installations respectively.

If you wish the package to install Subversion into someplace other than
/usr/local use the --prefix flag to indicate your desired prefix.
