The subdirectories contain distribution and platform specific versions of
RPM package builders.

To build from a Subversion checkout, just go to to the appropriate
directory and type "make" as a normal user.  This will create a
.rpmmacros file in your home directory (if it is not already there)
and build the RPM.
