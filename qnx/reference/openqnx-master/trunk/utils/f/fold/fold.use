fold - fold lines (POSIX)

fold [-b] [-s] [-w width] [file....]
Options:
 -b      Count width in bytes rather then column positions.
 -s      If a segment of a line contains a blank within the first width
         column positions, break the line after the last such blank meeting
         the width constraints.
 -w      Specify the maximum line length.
