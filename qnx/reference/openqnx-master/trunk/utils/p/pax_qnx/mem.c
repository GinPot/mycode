/* mem_get - allocate memory
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	Mem_get attempts to allocate a block of memory using the malloc
 *	function call.  In the event that the memory is not available, 
 *	mem_get will display an "Out of memory" message for the user
 *	the first time it encounters the an out of memory situation.
 *	Subsequent calls to mem_get may fail, but no message will be
 *	printed.
 *
 * PARAMETERS
 *
 *	uint len	- The amount of memory to allocate
 *
 * RETURNS
 *
 *	Normally returns the pointer to the newly allocated memory.  If
 *	an error occurs, NULL is returned, and an error message is
 *	printed.
 *
 * ERRORS
 *
 *	ENOMEM	No memory is available

/* mem_str - duplicate a string into dynamic memory
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	Mem_str attempts to make a copy of string.  It allocates space for
 *	the string, and if the allocation was successfull, copies the old
 *	string into the newly allocated space.
 *
 * PARAMETERS
 *
 *	char *str 	- string to make a copy of 
 *
 * RETURNS
 *
 *	Normally returns a pointer to a new string at least as large
 *	as strlen(str) + 1, which contains a copy of the the data 
 *	passed in str, plus a null terminator.  Returns (char *)NULL 
 *	if enough memory to make a copy of str is not available.
