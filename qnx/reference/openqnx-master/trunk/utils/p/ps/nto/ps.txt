Source Tree
The 'ps' utility is broken down into the following modules:
ps	This module contains main() and retrieves all the info about processes 
	and threads from the procfs resource manager.
output	This module displays info according to the layout. It also parses the
	paramter to the -o option and stores it in an internal format to 
	describe the layout.
filter	This module validates filter lists and determines whether a process 
	passes at least one of the filters.
