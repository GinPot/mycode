lpd - line printer spooler daemon

lpd [-l][-n] [port#]

Options:
 -l	The -l flag causes lpd to log valid requests received from the
 	network. This can be useful for debugging purposes.

 -n	No checking of job host.  Allows anyone on the network to print,
  	without validating the host.

 port#	The Internet port number used to rendezvous with other processes
 	is normally obtained with getservbyname(3) but can be changed
 	with the port# argument.
