NAME
     printcap - printer capability data base

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/printcap

DESCRIPTION
     printcap is a simplified version of the termcap(5) data base
     for  describing  printers.  The spooling system accesses the
     printcap file every time it is used, allowing dynamic  addi-
     tion  and deletion of printers.  Each entry in the data base
     describes one printer.  This data base may  not  be  substi-
     tuted  for, as is possible for termcap, because it may allow
     accounting to be bypassed.

     The default printer is normally lp, though  the  environment
     variable  PRINTER may be used to override this.  Each spool-
     ing utility supports a -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r option to explicitly name a
     destination printer.

     Each entry in the printcap file describes a printer, and  is
     a  line  consisting  of  a number of fields separated by `:'
     characters.  The first entry  for  each  printer  gives  the
     names  which  are  known  for  the printer, separated by `|'
     characters.  The first name is conventionally a number.  The
     second  name  given  is the most common abbreviation for the
     printer, and the last name given should be a long name fully
     identifying  the printer.  The second name should contain no
     blanks; the last name may well contain blanks for  readabil-
     ity.   Entries  may continue onto multiple lines by giving a
     `\' as the last character of a line, and empty fields may be
     included for readability.

     Capabilities in printcap are all introduced by two-character
     codes, and are of three types:

     _B_o_o_l_e_a_n   Capabilities that indicate that  the  printer  has
               some particular feature.  Boolean capabilities are
               simply written between the `:' characters, and are
               indicated by the word `bool' in the type column of
               the capabilities table below.

     _N_u_m_e_r_i_c   Capabilities  that  supply  information  such   as
               baud-rates,  number  of lines per page, and so on.
               Numeric capabilities are indicated by the word num
               in  the  type  column  of  the  capabilities table
               below.  Numeric  capabilities  are  given  by  the
               two-character  capability code followed by the `#'
               character, followed by  the  numeric  value.   The
               following  example is a numeric entry stating that
               this printer should run at 1200 baud:

                     :br#1200:

     _S_t_r_i_n_g    Capabilities that give a  sequence  which  can  be
               used to perform particular printer operations such
               as cursor motion.  String valued capabilities  are
               indicated  by  the  word str in the type column of
               the capabilities table below.  String valued capa-
               bilities are given by the two-character capability
               code followed by an `=' sign  and  then  a  string
               ending at the next following `:'.  For example,

                      :rp=spinwriter:

               is a sample entry stating that the remote  printer
               is named spinwriter.

     If the local line printer driver supports  indentation,  the
     daemon must understand how to invoke it.

     Note: the fs, fc, xs, and xc fields are  flag  _m_a_s_k_s  rather
     than flag _v_a_l_u_e_s.  Certain default device flags are set when
     the device is opened by the line printer daemon if the  dev-
     ice is connected to a terminal port.  The flags indicated in
     the fc field are then cleared; the flags in the fs field are
     then  set  (or vice-versa, depending on the order of fc#_n_n_n_n
     and fs#_n_n_n_n in the /etc/printcap file).  The bits cleared by
     the  fc  field  and  set  by  the  fs field are those in the
     sg_flags field  of  the  sgtty  structure,  as  set  by  the
     TIOCSETP  ioctl  call,  and the bits cleared by the xc field
     and set by the xs field are those in the "local flags" word,
     as  set  by the TIOCLSET ioctl call.  See ttcompat(4M) for a
     description of these flags.  For example, to set exactly the
     flags 06300 in the fs field, which specifies that the EVENP,
     ODDP, and XTABS modes are to be set, and all other flags are
     to be cleared, do:
          :fc#0177777:fs#06300:

     The same process applies to the xc and xs fields.   Alterna-
     tively,  the ms field can be used to specify modes to be set
     and cleared.  These modes are specified as  stty(1V)  modes;
     any  mode supported by stty may be specified, except for the
     baud rate which must be specified with the br  field.   This
     permits  modes not supported by the older terminal interface
     described in ttcompat(4M) to be set or cleared. Thus, to set
     the  terminal  port to which the printer is attached to even
     parity, TAB expansion, no NEWLINE to RETURN/LINEFEED  trans-
     lation, and RTS/CTS flow control enabled, do:
          :ms=evenp,-tabs,nl,crtscts:
     On Sun386i systems, the tc field, as in the termcap(5) file,
     must  appear last in the list of capabilities.  It is recom-
     mended that each  type  of  printer  have  a  general  entry
     describing  common  capabilities; then an individual printer
     can be defined with its particular capabilities  plus  a  tc
     field  that  points  to  the  general entry for that type of
     printer.
