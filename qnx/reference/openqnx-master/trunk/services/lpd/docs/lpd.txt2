NAME
     lpd - line printer spooler daemon

SYNOPSIS
     lpd [-l] [port#]

DESCRIPTION
     Lpd is the line printer daemon (spool area handler)  and  is
normally in-
     voked  at	boot  time from the /etc/config/sysinit file.  It
makes a single pass through
     the printcap(5) file to find out about the existing printers
and prints
     any  files left after a crash. It then uses the system calls
listen(2) and
     accept(2) to receive requests to print files in  the  queue,
transfer files
     to the spooling area, display the queue, or remove jobs from
the queue.
     In each case, it forks a child to handle the request so  the
parent can
     continue to listen for more requests.

     Available options:

     -l	The  -l  flag  causes lpd to log valid requests re-
ceived from the
	     network. This can be useful for debugging	purposes.

     port#    The  Internet  port  number used to rendezvous with
other processes
	     is normally obtained with getservbyname(3)	but  can
be changed
	     with the port# argument.

     Access control is provided by two means. First, all requests
must come
     from one of the machines listed in the file /etc/hosts.equiv
or
     /etc/hosts.lpd. Second, if the rs capability is specified in
the printcap
     entry for the printer being accessed, lpr requests will only
be honored
     for those users with accounts on the machine with the print-
er.

     The file minfree in each spool directory contains the number
of disk
     blocks  to	leave	free so that the line printer queue won't
completely fill
     the disk.	The minfree file can be edited with your favorite
text editor.

     The daemon begins processing files after it has successfully
set the lock
     for exclusive access (descibed a bit later), and  scans  the
spool directo-
     ry for files beginning with cf. Lines in each cf file speci-
fy files to be
     printed or non-printing actions to be performed.  Each  such
line begins
     with  a key character to specify what to do with the remain-
der of the
     line.

     J	Job Name.	String to be used for the job name on the
burst page.

     C	Classification.  String to be used for the classifi-
cation line on
	     the burst page.

     L	Literal.  The line contains identification info from
the password
	     file and causes the banner page to be printed.

     T	Title.  String to be used as the title for pr(1).

     H	Host  Name.   Name of the machine where lpr was in-
voked.

     P	Person.  Login name of the person who  invoked  lpr.
This is used
	     to verify ownership by lprm.

     M	Send  mail  to  the specified user when the current
print job com-
	     pletes.

     f	Formatted File.  Name of a file to	print	which  is
already format-

	     ted.

     l	Like  ``f''  but passes control characters and does
not make page
	     breaks.

     p	Name of a file to print using pr(1) as a filter.

     t	Troff File.  The file contains troff(1) output  (cat
phototypeset-
	     ter commands).

     n	Ditroff File.  The file contains device independent
troff output.

     r	DVI File.	The file contains Tex l output DVI format
from Stand-
	     ford).

     g	Graph  File.   The  file	contains data produced by
plot(3).

     c	Cifplot File. The file  contains  data  produced  by
cifplot.

     v	The file contains a raster image.

     r	The  file	contains text data with FORTRAN carriage
control charac-
	     ters.

     1	Troff Font R. Name of the font file to  use  instead
of the de-
	     fault.

     2	Troff  Font I. Name of the font file to use instead
of the de-
	     fault.

     3	Troff Font B. Name of the font file to  use  instead
of the de-
	     fault.

     4	Troff  Font S. Name of the font file to use instead
of the de-
	     fault.

     W	Width. Changes the page width (in	characters)  used
by pr(1) and
	     the text filters.

     I	Indent.  The number of characters to indent the out-
put by (in
	     ascii).

     U	Unlink.  Name of file to remove upon  completion  of
printing.

     N	File  name.   The	name  of the file which is being
printed, or a
	     blank for the standard input (when lpr is invoked in
a pipeline).

     If	a  file  can not be opened, a message will be logged via
syslog(3) using
     the LOG_LPR facility.  Lpd will try up to 20 times to reopen
a file it
     expects to be there, after which it will skip the file to be
printed.

     Lpd uses flock(2) to provide exclusive access  to	the  lock
file and to
     prevent  multiple deamons from becoming active simultaneous-
ly.  If the
     daemon should be killed or die unexpectedly, the  lock  file
need not be
     removed.  The lock file is kept in a readable ASCII form and
contains two
     lines.  The first is the process id of the	daemon	and  the
second is the
     control  file  name  of  the current job being printed.  The
second line is
     updated to reflect the current status of lpd  for	the  pro-
grams lprq(1) and
     lprrm(1).

FILES
     /etc/printcap	 printer description file
     /usr/spool/*	  spool directories
     /usr/spool/*/minfree  minimum free space to leave


     /etc/hosts.equiv	lists  machine  names allowed printer
access
     /etc/hosts.lpd	lists machine  names	allowed  printer
access, but not
			   under same administrative control.
